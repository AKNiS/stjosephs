# St Josephs Cowper Website redesign. 

Gulp Framework is an incomplete BETA created by a friend of mine. He's allowed me to use it for various projects, although techincally he's not the owner of it (the studio he works for is), it's also not a complete package and contains little more than coding snippets that can be found all over the web, just organised into sub-folders better. 


No-one has a completely clean copy as it's been put together over various jobs. 
This version is from my Gin's website, SAWSE, so ensure that any names are switched over to StJosephs before starting. 

Use only the bits you need (if at all) 

Feel free to edit, add, chop, change, use, notuse, whatever. I've not married to this framework, or any framework, whichever you find quickest to develop in. 


I've set you up in podio also.
