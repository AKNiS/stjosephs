Installation
____________

1. Open cmd.exe for Windows or Terminal for OSX.
2. Navigate to the directory where package.json and gulpfile.js are located.
3. Run one of the following commands:

npm install (Windows)

sudo npm install (OSX)

This will download and install the dependencies for the build, it can take a while on slow connections. If you get any console errors that are unable to be resolved please email details to sam@thirststudios.com along with a screenshot of the error messages.


Build Commands
______________

gulp

: Run the build init and then watch for changes.


gulp watch

: Watch the build for changes.


gulp --type prod

: Run the build with minified code and remove source maps for production / live deployment.


Distribution
____________

Assets generated by the build will be put in the /public directory (or whatever you define in the gulpfile.js paths config options).


CSS
___

!important should only ever be used for testing purposes or to override inline styles set by third party plugins.

Use classnames instead of IDs - this promotes reuse and lets developers take advantage of natural selector weights. IDs should only be used for javascript hooks or if a third party component or plugin requires the use of a specific ID.

The 'gulp watch' command will automatically compile the SASS files on save, it will also notify you of any CSS errors and will not complete the build until these have been fixed up.

The build will compile everything into one CSS file in the order defined in src/styles/main.scss

The SASS build will auto prefix vendor prefixes such as -webkit- or -moz- where appropriate, but do not rely on Autoprefixer alone and be dilligent during your browser testing.


Javascript
__________

Currently the js build is not enabled and is in-progress.

For now it's fine to work in public/assets/js/scripts.js - please keep your code well organised and commented.

Libraries and Plugins go in public/assets/js/dependencies.js
Please add comments for the name of the plugin and a link to the documentation if relevant.
